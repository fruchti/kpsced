# kpsced

A small script for recoloring postscript files generated by KiCAD's Eeschema (*kpsced* stands for KiCAD postscript color editor). It is able to alter the color of every setting which can be made in Eeschema, but is not limited to Eeschema's 30 predefined colors.

It parses Eeschema's configuration file to determine its color settings. Thus, it is fairly independent on your Eeschema setup.

## Usage

    kpsced [options] FILE

By default *kpsced* overwrites the specified postscript file, unless an output file is given via the `-o` flag. It uses the Eeschema configuration file located in `~/.config/kicad/eeschema` but a different path can be designated with `-k`.

`-j` analyzes Eeschema's configuration and gives an overview of repeatedly used colors. This is useful for tweaking the color settings until no duplicates are left.

For the full list of color options, refer to `kpsced --help`. The colors are specified in the standard 6-character hexadecimal RGB format (like `#ffffff`). For convenience, the `#` can be omitted.

*kpsced* can generate a color scheme file from the color settings given via command line arguments with the `--generate` flag. This file can be used with the `-m` flag to specify all color replacements at once.

## Limitations

*kpsced* is used as an postprocessor for Eeschema-generated postscript files. Because of this, there is one main limitation: *kpsced* cannot assign different colors to elements which have the same color settings in Eeschema. If you want a really colorful output, you will have to edit your Eeschema settings so all elements are colored differently by default. Keep in mind that Eeschema uses the color *Red 2* for the schematic title block, which cannot be changed in the settings. Use the `-j` flag to check whether some colors are used repeatedly.
